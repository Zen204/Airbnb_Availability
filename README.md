Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict whether an Airbnb listing will have availability. The dataset includes various features related to the listings, hosts, and reviews. Accurately forecasting availability aims to enhance the guest experience, optimize host management, and improve the overall efficiency of the Airbnb platform.

Technologies Used* 
- Data Collection & Preparation**: pandas  
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): spaCy, NLTK  
- Data Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

Significance of the Problem  

- Enhanced Guest Experience: By ensuring guests only view available listings, the model minimizes frustration, leading to a smoother and more satisfying booking experience.
- Optimized Host Operations: Helps hosts better manage their listings, enabling them to develop strategies to increase occupancy rates and streamline their processes.
- Platform Efficiency: Improves the search algorithm, leading to more accurate search results, higher conversion rates, and better resource utilization.
- Revenue Growth: Boosting occupancy rates leads to higher revenue for both Airbnb and hosts, maximizing profitability.
- Strategic Insights: Offers actionable insights into the factors that affect availability, allowing hosts to make data-driven decisions to improve their listings' performance.
